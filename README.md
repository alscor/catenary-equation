# catenary-equation
A solution to a hanging cable problem

>* The shape of a hanging cable or a rope represents a so-called catenary line (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary ).
>* For caternary lines, critical parameters are: 
>  - L, Length of the cable
>  - a, or Sag - the vertical distance between hanging points and the lowest point of the cable
>* Assume that the minimum point is located at (0,0) coordinate. 
>* The poles are positioned at -Xi and Xi, the distance between poles = 2*Xi
>* The pole height can be viewed as the sag + some arbitrary, "slack" value, so that Pole height = sag + slack. 
>* Note that when the sag value = 1/2 of the cable's length, then the cable is hanging freely, the distance between poles = 0. 
>* We need to find Xi, at which the lengh of the rope = L (80m)
